Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday
  | tuesday
  | wednesday
  | thursday
  | friday
  | saturday
  | sunday.

Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
  | monday    => tuesday
  | tuesday   => wednesday
  | wednesday => thursday
  | thursday  => friday
  | friday    => monday
  | saturday  => monday
  | sunday    => monday
  end.

Compute (next_weekday monday).

Compute (next_weekday (next_weekday friday)).

Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.
